# 3DprintParametricShape
added 3D-print option (aka STL output) to Parametric Surface example.

Used it to print möbius band inspired shape; ellips moved+rotated along circle:

You need to websearch for "repair STL" too, as the result will have a gap (which is a problem for your 3D-printer, even though you don't see it on your screen)
